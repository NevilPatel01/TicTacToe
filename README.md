# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This interactive game allows you to play Tic Tac Toe with a twist â€“ instead of 'X' and 'O', you'll use colors 'Blue' and 'Red' to mark your moves. Let's get started!

## Game Instructions:

- Choose Initial Color: Enter either 'Blue' or 'Red' to choose the initial color to start the game.

- Apply Color: Click on the "Apply Color" button to apply your chosen color to the game board.

- Restart Game: Click on the "Restart Game" button to reset the game and start over.

- Steps taken by Red: Displays the number of steps taken by the player with the Red color.

- Steps taken by Blue: Displays the number of steps taken by the player with the Blue color.

## Developer's Note:

This Tic Tac Toe game is inspired by the original version but with a creative twist of using colors instead of traditional 'X' and 'O'. By default, the first color will be blue and the second will be red.
